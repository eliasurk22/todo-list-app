# todo-list-app
Hello there! I am Elias, and this is a project that i did for my summer internship: a to-do list app!
The languages used here are HTML and CSS for the front end, with Vue.js for the functionalities!
Now, here's how you run this app without any issues in your device:
1) install the custom fonts from the fonts folder to ensure the layout loads as intended
2) download the files and save them all in one common directory.
3) double click "index.html" to launch the app!
