# todo-list-app
Hello there! I am Elias, and this is a project that i did for my summer internship: a to-do list app!
The languages used here are HTML and CSS for the front end, with Vue.js for the functionalities!
Now, here's how you run this app without any issues in your device:
1) install the custom fonts to ensure the layout loads as intended
2) download the files and save them all in one common directory, and make a fonts folder in the same directory and save the font otf/ttf files there.
3) double click "index.html" to launch the app!
